Description: Notetaking software designed around a tablet
 Xournal++ is not Xournal! It is a ground-up rewrite of Xournal
 in a different language (C++ instead of C). The purpose was to
 create a more flexible application that significantly extends
 the functionality of Xournal. At the moment, Xournal is very stable
 software while Xournal++ is not. If you want stability, you might
 be more interested in the original Xournal project.
